🚀 DSA Practice Repository
📌 About

This repository contains my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I regularly solve problems from platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks and upload optimized solutions here.

The purpose of this repository is to build strong fundamentals, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare for product-based companies and GATE 2026.

Consistency and discipline are the keys to success.

🎯 Goals

✔️ Maintain daily consistency in solving DSA problems

✔️ Strengthen core CS concepts

✔️ Master common DSA patterns and techniques

✔️ Improve time and space optimization

✔️ Prepare for coding interviews and internships

✔️ Track progress and growth
